## Overview
This Ansible project is separated into two parts. 

## Ansible components

### Ansible configuration file
The Ansible configuration file (ansible.cfg) contains the default configuration relevant to the roles (scripts) that will be used in this project. For example, the path to the Host file with the information of the host machines that will be used.

### Hosts file
The host file contains the host machines on which the Ansible scripts run on. It contains the host names, their IP addresses, and the groups the hosts are sorted to.

### Variables
